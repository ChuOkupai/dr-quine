# 👾 dr-quine

This educational project is part of the [42 School](https://www.42.fr) curriculum.

It provides a basic understanding of the concept of self-replicating programs, also known as quines.

I have implemented my quines in three different programming languages: C, ASM, and Python.

## 🧪 Tests

In order to test the project, you can run the following command:
```sh
for lang in C ASM Python; do make -C $lang test; done
```
